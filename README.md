# Experiment_Word_Embeddings_and_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Spam_Detection

Objective: Experimenting various word embedding techniques and machine learning models for spam emails detection.

Word embedding techniques:
- CountVectorizer
- CountVectorizer(w/N-gram)
- TfidfVectorizer
- Word2Vec (leveraging pre-trained model and model training using gensim)
- Doc2Vec (model training using gensim)
- Recurrent Neural Network (word padding)

Machine learning models:
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM)

Model evaluation:
- Grid search
- Grid search with cross validation
